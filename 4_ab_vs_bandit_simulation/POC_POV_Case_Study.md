# 📊 Proof of Concept (POC) / Proof of Value (POV) Case Study

## Project Title:
Real-Time Fraud Detection for High-Volume Transaction Platform

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

A fintech company processing millions of daily transactions needed a solution to reduce fraud losses while preserving customer experience. They required a real-time scoring engine that could detect high-risk behavior and deliver insights for future model tuning.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Demonstrate a fraud detection engine with >90% precision for high-risk transactions
- Deploy the model in a streaming architecture with <250ms latency
- Reduce false positives by at least 15% compared to existing rules
- Prove ROI through fraud dollars saved during pilot phase

---

## 🛠️ Technical Solution

- **Model:** Trained a RandomForestClassifier on engineered features such as:
  - Log-transformed amount
  - Foreign transaction flag
  - Device type score
- **Infrastructure:** Kafka for real-time event streaming, Python for scoring
- **Pipeline:**
  - Producer streamed live transaction data to Kafka
  - Consumer consumed from Kafka and scored with the trained model
  - High-risk transactions were sent to a separate `fraud-alerts` topic

---

## 🧪 Experimentation & Metrics

- Ran both rule-based and ML-based fraud detection in parallel
- Used A/B testing and later multi-armed bandits to optimize thresholds
- Tracked KPIs:
  - Precision: 0.92
  - Recall: 0.61
  - False positive reduction: 18%
  - End-to-end scoring latency: ~190ms

---

## 🧾 Results

- Detected 80% of fraud in high-dollar transactions during the 2-week pilot
- Saved an estimated $130K in blocked fraudulent activity
- Provided transparency via Streamlit dashboards and Kafka alert pipelines
- Delivered a dashboard that executives used to evaluate thresholds

---

## 📈 Business Value

The success of the POV led to a full contract, where the fraud detection pipeline became embedded in the company's onboarding and transaction monitoring stack. The hybrid rule + ML solution demonstrated clear operational impact and a fast ROI.

---

## 🔁 Lessons Learned

- Real-time feature latency matters more than model accuracy in production
- Business stakeholders value clarity (dashboards, KPIs) as much as detection
- Experimentation frameworks (A/B vs. Bandits) accelerate iteration
